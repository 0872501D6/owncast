Here are some details and tips specific to using S3 for storage.

## File expiration 

You should expire old segments on your S3 bucket.  [Here are some instructions on how to do that.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/create-lifecycle.html)

* Once an object expires you won't be charged for storage, even if the object isn't deleted immediately.
* A one day object expiration lifecycle rule on objects is as low as you can go, so use that.
* Because AWS [rounds the expiration to midnight of the next day](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/s3-lifecycle-rule-delay/)  you may have a lot of old video chunks sitting around.  You can make the most of this by increasing the `maxNumberInPlaylist` value in your config file to something much higher, allowing users to rewind your stream back in time further.  If the video is available then you might as well make it available to your users.

## CORS

* Ugh.  CORS.  [You will need to enable CORS on your bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html#how-do-i-enable-cors) so the web player can access the video.
