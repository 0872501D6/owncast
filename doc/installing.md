Transcoding is done with ffmpeg and that is the one dependency this project requires.  So make sure it exists.

* Download from https://www.johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/ and point your config file at it if needed.
* You will need a somewhat recent version of ffmpeg (TODO: figure out what exact version).
